# Code in Place'21
Code in place is an initiative by <b style="color:red;"><i>Stanford University</i></b> for the students to learn Python Programming.
</br>
This program contains <i><b>CS106</b></i> course's 1st half part in syllabus.
</br>
I am glad to be a part of the community.
</br>
In the course project I made <i>Conway's Game of Life's</i> pictorial representation.
<h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
Conway's Game of Life project made at Stanford University

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automation presented by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
<ul>
<li><h2>Rules</h2>

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:
<ul>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
<li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
<li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
</ul><br/>
The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
  </br>
  <li><h2>Components</h2>
  
  I used following libraries of python:
  <ul>
    <li>numpy
    <li>pygame
  </ul>

  <li><h2>How to use</h2>

  Use these following steps:
    <ul>
      <li>The main function for pointers is inside <i><a href="main.py">main.py</a>.</i>
      <li>The pictorial components are in <i><a href="grid.py">grid.py</a>.</i>
      <li>Both files are already linked.
      <li>Run <i><a href="main.py">main.py</a></i>.
  </ul>
  </ul>

  I have added <i><a href="get-pip.py">get-pip.py</a></i> file in case you want to learn more about <i>pygame</i> library.
